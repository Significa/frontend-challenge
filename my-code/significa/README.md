# "What's in" Front-End Challenge

### `Hello!`

This is my implementation of a movie search React application, a take-home challenge created by Significa (an Oporto based digital studio).

The app - [**What's in**](https://whats-in.netlify.app/) - is divided in two pages: an initial **home page**, where we can search for movies according to title, and a second one, where we can check info about a **specific movie**.

- **Home page:** search field and a list with the results (_it also has an empty state, a loading state and movie not found condition_)

- **Movie page:** movie details page (_it also has a loading state and movie not found condition_)

Since it was a simple project, I decided to bootstrap it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start

1. Get an API key from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
2. Copy this folder (`significa`).
3. Create a file called `.env` in the root of the projectâ€™s directory.
4. Inside the `.env` file, assign your API key to `REACT_APP_API_KEY` (like so: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key`).
5. On your terminal, install dependencies by running `npm install`.
6. Start app in development mode by running `npm start`.
7. Test app by running `npm test`.
8. To build app for production to the `build` folder, run `npm run build`.
9. **This app is now ready to be deployed!**

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
