# What's in Front-End Challenge

### `Hello!`

This is my implementation of a movie search React application, a take-home challenge created by Significa (an Oporto based digital studio).

The app is divided in two pages: an initial **homepage**, where we can search for movies according to title, and a second one, where we can check info about a **specific movie**.

- **Home page:** search field and a list with the results;

  _It has an empty state, a loading state and movie not found_

- **Movie page:** movie details page;

  _It has a loading state and movie not found_

Since it was a simple project, I decided to bootstrap it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### **Your app is now ready to be deployed!**
