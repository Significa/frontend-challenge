# Test - Significa

https://github.com/Significa/frontend-challenge

This is a pretty simple test, in which you should be able to write a React app, using the provided screens as reference. You’ll need to make requests to an API to get some JSON content, filter the data and print it on view.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

#####The app should be a movie search with two pages:
- Home page: search field and a list with the results;

    _Think about empty state, loading state and movie not found_

- Movie page: movie details page;

    _Think about loading state and movie not found_

### Project status
- Main objectives were achieved. :heavy_check_mark:
- Added a debounce function to wait a few seconds until a user stops typing to fetch search results. ⏱
- Made it Responsive for the mobile version 📱
- The "like" button is persistent (localStorage) 💿
- Never done tests before, so i tried some using the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) 🐙
